Question 7.1

You have a BBall hoop and someone says that you can play one of the two games.

Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.

If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick one game or the other?

My solution:
You want to pick Game 1 if you have a high probability of success, and the opposite for Game 2.

Game 1: Probability is simply p because you take one shot.
Game 2: Probability is a little more complicated:
You succeed if you make 2 or 3 shots. Probability of making three shots is p^3.
Probability of making 2 shots can be divided into three cases, making shots 1 and 2, making shots 2 and 3, and making shots 1 and 3. Each of these cases has probability p*p(1-p). Added up, this is 3p^2(1-p). The entire probability for game two is the sum of both cases, which is p^3+3p^2(1-p)

You would pick game 1 when p > p^3+3p^2(1-p)...
p > 3p^2-3p^3+p^3 = 3p^2-2p^3
Factor out a p:
1 > 3p - 2p^2
2p^2-3p+1 > 0
(2p-1)(p-1) > 0
When p = 1, the left side is (1)(0) which means probability of both games is equal. Same goes for p = 1/2 and p = 0. The probability of Game 1 is higher than game 2 for all values less than 1/2 but above 0 because then both terms on the left are negative.

It is in your favor to play game 2 if p is above 1/2 and less than 1.
