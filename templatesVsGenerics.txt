14.4 What is the difference between templates(C++) and generics(JAVA)?
In C++ templates are a glorified macro set. The compiler creates a new copy of the
template code for each type. In Java, generics are "syntactic sugar", or they make
things look prettier.

Java generics do not permit primitive types, so you must use Integer rather than int.

In Java the type parameter cannot be used for static methods and variables.

All instances of MyClass, regardless of type paramenters, are the same.
