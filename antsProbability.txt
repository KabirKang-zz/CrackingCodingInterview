7.2 Question:
3 ants are on the 3 vertices of a triangle. What is the probability of a collision between them if they start walking in a direction, each direction being equally likely for each ant?

What is the probability in the general case of an n-sided polygon?

Answer:
The probability of a collision is 1-(probability of no collision).
There is no collision when they all go in the same direction.
1/2*1/2*1/2 = 1/8, but multiply this by two because they could all go clockwise or counterclockwise, equally likely. Probability of no collision = 1/4.
Probability of collision = 1-1/4 = 3/4

General case:
2(1/2)^n = (1/2)^(n-1) 
Probability of collision = 1-(1/2)^(n-1)
