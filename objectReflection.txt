14.5 Explain what object reflection is in Java and why it is useful.

Object reflection provides a way to get relective information about Java classes and
objects and perform operations like getting info about methods and fields present in the
class at runtime, creating new instances of class, getting and setting object fields 
directly regardless of what the access modifier is.

1. Helps in observing/manipulating runtime behavior of applications
2. Can help debugging or testing programs because we have direct access to methods,
constructors, and fields.
3. We can call methods by name when we don't know the method in advance.
