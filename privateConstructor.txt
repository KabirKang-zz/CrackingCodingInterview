14.1 In terms of inheritance, what is the effect of keeping a constructor private?

What can access the private methods of a class C? Other than C itself, the inner classes 
of C can access C's private methods and constructor. Also, if C is an inner class of B,
then B's other inner classes can access the private constructor.

How does this affect inheritance?
Class C can only be inherited by its or its parents inner classes. This is important
due to the fact that subclasses call the constructors of their parents.
