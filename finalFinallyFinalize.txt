14.3 What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize?

Final:
For variable primitives, it means the value of the variable cannot change.
For variable references, the reference variable cannot point to any other object on
the heap.
For methods, the method cannot be overriden.
For classes, the class cannot be subclassed.

Finally:
You can use finally as a part of try-catch. Statements in the finally block will always
be exectuted, unless the try block exits.

Finalize():
The finalize method is called by the garbage collector when it determines that no
more references exist. It is usually used to clean up resources.
A class can override the finalize method in order to define custom behavior.
